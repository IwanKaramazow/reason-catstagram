# reason-catstagram

My very first ReasonReact app, of course, about cats! 🐈

## DevTools (vscode)

- Remove all prior reason plugins
- Download https://github.com/jaredly/reason-language-server/releases
- In the vscode extensions panel, open the menu and click "Install from VSIX...".

## Install

```sh
npm i
```

## Development

```sh
# run the bsb compiler
npm run bsb

# in another tab
npm run bundle

# and finally...
open localhost:1234
```
